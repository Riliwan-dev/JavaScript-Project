Description:

This project is a web application that displays real-time weather information for the user's current location or a specified location. It leverages HTML, Bootstrap CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

Functionality:

Offers the option to search for weather in a different location.
May provide additional features like weather forecasts, hourly breakdowns, and visual representations (icons, graphs) based on your implementation.
Technologies:

HTML: Used for structuring the content and defining the basic layout of the app.
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework that provides pre-built styles and components for creating responsive web interfaces.
JavaScript: Used for dynamic behavior, such as fetching weather data from an API, handling user input, and updating the UI.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A text editor or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
For live weather data: An account with a free weather API provider like OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).
Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the app.

Customization:

You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of the app by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
If you're using a weather API, remember to update the API key with your own key.
